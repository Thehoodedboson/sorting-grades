# Second small project

This small CLI project takes an int number of students, applies that number to a dynamic array. The program then uses a for loop to ask for the name and grades of each student. Once the names and grades are entered, a function is called to sort the array from higest grade to lowest grade. Another for loop is then used to iterate through the array so the program can give the output of the sorting function.

## Sidenote!

I'm not even sure anyone is reading this, if so hello! 
I'm still trying to figure out what files to include when pushing a repository to Github. I'm sure further research will improve my Github usage and etiquette. This program probably could've been created much easier and improved if I had used **std::vector<>**, but the problem asked to a dynamic array insted. I'm not too sure on how to implement a way to catch wrong input, but once I learn how to I'll come back here and improve upon this. Special thanks to [learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/) for providing the problem! I found pointers an interesting topic to learn about; however, more research into pointers could most likely be very beneficial.
That's about all for now, I'm sure I'm going to delete these eventually, but having at least something on here can be beneficial, at least I hope.
